# AuD Documentation

This Repo includes AuD (Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen) tasks from Summer 2024 at the Otto-von-Guericke-Universit√§t (OvGU) Magdeburg.

This Repo is very much not complete. If you are missing any specific task, just create a feature request.
All tasks implemented at tag `Blatt12` / `EndOfSemester` are tested and / or voted, and recieved green smilies / max number of green ticks.
All tasks implemented afterwards are only locally tested, and can't be guaranteed to work.

## Important
